1. This is a good case study on Campus Bridging for life science workflows. The paper could improve by providing better performance data on the file system problem which is common for those workflows. It would be good to describe where the bottlenecks of the application are.

-- The filesystem problems were occurring right when we were making the transition from Ranger to Stampede. Did not experience problems on Stampede. Cannot do much here. 

2. Case study paper covering the transition of a computational workload from the workstation, via local campus clusters, to XSEDE resources. Makes a strong argument for allocating manpower resources to help guide the process through proposal writing, code porting and tuning, and workflow scaling and testing. Discusses the utility and issues in using the SAGA BigJob framework along with the efforts required to improve the compute application's behavior and reduce the workflow's impact on shared parallel filesystems. While there is good data on the preliminary testing and scaling of the workflow, it would have been nice to see performance numbers for the larger research runs as well. In particular if components such as I/O behavior could be monitored, since this is referred to as a limiting factor.

3. This paper describes many of the challenges faced by new users moving from a campus resource to XSEDE. It follows a project from development of a proposal through completion of a set of production runs. A new position of "campus bridging expert" is proposed. Campus champions are volunteers who serve their local research communities by introducing potential users to the XSEDE program, but there are known cases of champions contributing to pre-award and even post-award efforts. Therefore, the suggested role of bridging expert seems to be valid. The paper also presents a case study of high throughput computing. It includes descriptions of the target application (mlRho out of Max-Planck Institute), the collaboration between Indiana's Pervasive Technology Institute and M-PI aimed at optimization of mlRho, the BigJob framework used to manage large collections of serial jobs and, finally, preliminary scientific results. There is a lot of good information here, but it doesn't flow very well. If accepted, the authors should consider splitting out some of the material, maybe as an appendix, to improve focus.

-- Don't know what we can do here about splitting out some of the material. 

4. This paper provides a very good example of how to transition from using campus resources to XSEDE resources. It does an excellent job of providing the scientific background and the steps they took for the transitioning to XSEDE. The paper does not discuss the scalability of this model and the funding sources for the domain experts to support the different disciplines on a given campus.

-- May be say something about possible funding models?
